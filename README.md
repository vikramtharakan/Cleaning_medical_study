# Cleaning_medical_study
Goes through a medical study and cleans the findings in order to make analyzing easier


## Intro
<p> This repository contains the data from a medical study that tests the effictiveness of 2 drugs; auralin and novodra. Data is ficticious but based off of studies that have taken place. The data stored is quite messy and needs to be cleaned for further analyzing, and that is what the contents of this repository go through</p> 

## Directions

<p>Load in all the .csv files to your local directory to perform analysis on the data. To see what steps I took, view the cleaning HTML or ipynb file. </p>
